# nsls2-xf-utils
2015-02-07 -- gjw
Begin to collect tools used at SRX during commissioning in a repository.
Initial commit is comprised of python scripts depending on non-standard pacakges:  pyepics, terminaltables, and colorclass
Most scripts have some details specific to SRX "hard-coded" and are poorly commented
